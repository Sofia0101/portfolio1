          Born in 1994 in Osaka, Japan.
          I believe
          web design 
          can be <br /> more
          diverse and inspiring. 
          With a mission
          to present <br />
          the possibilities
          of web design.
          I am pursuin <br />

          through experiments
          and thoughts.
