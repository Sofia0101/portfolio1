        I was born in 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina <br />
       I think web design can be more diverse and inspiring☄️ <br />
       My aspiration is to present the possibilities of web design​​​. <br />
       The activities that I enjoy the most are listening to music and singing, which encourage me to find new ideas💡​<br /> A long time ago I entered the world of programming, and since then I haven't stopped learning, working and having fun with it!
